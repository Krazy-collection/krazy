The Krazy README
================
Krazy scans KDE source code looking for issues that should be fixed
for reasons of policy, good coding practice, optimization, or any other
good reason.  In typical use, Krazy simply counts up the issues
and provides the line numbers where those issues occurred in each
file processed.  With the verbose option, the offending content will
be printed as well.

Krazy uses "sanity checker programs" which are small plugin programs
to do the real work of the scanning.  It is easy to write your own plugins
and tell Krazy how to use them.

Donate Plugins!  I'll include your cool plugin with this package if it
has an OSS-approved license!


Usage on your local machine:
----------------------------
For individual files use the krazy2 script and provide the filenames you 
want to check.

For checking a whole directory including subdirectories, cd into the
topmost directory you want to check and run the krazy2all script from there.

The commandline options for both can be obtained by providing the --help option.


Exempting lines, files and directories from the checks:
-------------------------------------------------------
1. Exempting individual lines from specific checks
  Provide a C++ comment at the line like this
  //krazy:exclude=<name1[,name2,...,nameN]> 
  Where nameX is the name of one of the plugins

2. Exempting a whole file from specific checks
  Provide a C++ comment at the line like this
  //krazy:excludeall=<name1[,name2,...,nameN]>
  Where nameX is the name of one of the plugins

3. Exempting a whole file from all checks
  Provide a C++ comment in the file like this
  //krazy:skip

4. Exempting project subdirectories from checks
  Provide a .krazy file in the top-level module directory containing
  the project subdirectories to skip, for example if you want to exclude
  kdepim/kmail and kdepim/kontact the kdepim/.krazy file would be:
  IGNORESUBS kmail,kontact

  Warning: this directive only works at the module level.
  Use the SKIP directive for directories below the module level.

5. Exempting files or directories from checks
  Provide a .krazy file in the topmost directory and use
  regular expressions to specify the files that should not
  be checked. For example to exclude kcal/libical, kcal/versit
  and kcal/fred.c in the kdepimlibs module put this .krazy file
  into kdepimlib/kcal
  SKIP /libical/\|/versit/\|fred\.c

Note: The comments need to be C++ comments and cannot be embedded
      into C comments, so if you need to exempt a plain C file
      use a .krazy file and the SKIP directive.
