"Krazy" Installation Instructions

Make sure you have the required software installed first.
See the "Requirements" section below.


"Easy" Krazy Installation Instructions
======================================
The easiest and safest way to install Krazy is by using the simple
install script called 'install.sh'.  Make sure that the first 'qmake'
found in your execute path is from Qt4 and then run:

  % ./install.sh

which will install by default into /usr/local/Krazy2. Set another
installation directory by passing it to 'install.sh' on the command line,
like so:

  % ./install.sh /another/location

If your Qt4 'qmake' has another name (some distros do this, for example
Fedora11 calls it 'qmake-qt4'), then set the QMAKE environment variable
before calling install.sh.  For example:

  % QMAKE=qmake-qt4 ./install.sh

Next you must add /usr/local/Krazy2/bin (or /another/location/bin)
to your execute path.

  % export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Krazy2/bin
    or
  % export PATH=$PATH:/another/location/bin

Now, the 'krazy2 --list' command should show you a list of available plugins.


"Hard" Krazy Installation Instructions
======================================
Read the 'install.sh' script included with this package
and try to figure it out yourself. :)


Requirements
=============
As of this writing there are several perl modules required that may
not normally ship with a typical O/S distribution. These modules are
checked for when the top-level Makefile.PL is processed.
The modules are:
  HTML::Parser
  File::Find
  Tie::IxHash
  XML::LibXML

Otherwise, Krazy should work with all known operating systems where
Qt4 and perl are available. If this is not true, please let me know.
