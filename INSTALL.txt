"Krazy" Installation Instructions

Make sure you have the required software installed first.
See =Requirements= section below.

"Easy" Krazy Installation Instructions
======================================
The easiest and safest way to install Krazy is by using the simple
install script called 'install.sh'.  Make sure that the first 'qmake'
found in your execute path is from Qt4 and then run:

  % ./install.sh

which will install by default into /usr/local/Krazy. Set another
installation directory by passing it to 'install.sh' on the command line,
like so:

  % ./install.sh /another/location

Next you must add /usr/local/Krazy/bin (or /another/location/bin)
to your execute path.

  % export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Krazy/bin
    or
  % export PATH=$PATH:/another/location/bin

Finally, tell Krazy where to find the plugins by setting the KRAZY_PLUGIN_PATH
environment variable:

  % export KRAZY_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/Krazy/libexec/krazy-plugins
    or
  % export KRAZY_PLUGIN_PATH=/another/location/libexec/krazy-plugins


Now, the 'krazy --list' command should show you a list of available plugins.


Documentation
=============
For quick help run 'krazy --help'
For detailed help,
  you can run 'man krazy', assuming you have added the path
  /usr/local/Krazy/share/man added to your MANPATH
    or
  run 'perldoc /usr/local/Krazy/bin/krazy'


"Hard" Krazy Installation Instructions
======================================
If you must do things the hard way, then the following should help you:

the following steps are needed (to be done in the directory which
contains the top-level Makefile.PL)

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make

If the build succeeds, install it with the following command:

  % make install

Next, build and install the helpers:

  % cd helpers
  % make install

Build and install the non-binary plugins:

  % cd plugins
  % make install

Build and install the binary plugins:

  % cd src
  % /path/to/qt4/bin/qmake
  % make
  % make install

Finally, set up your $PATH and $KRAZY_PLUGIN_PATH environment variables
as shown above.


Requirements
=============
As of this writing there are several perl modules required that may
not normally ship with a typical O/S distribution. These modules are
checked for when the top-level Makefile.PL is processed.
The modules are:
  HTML::Parser
  File::Find
  Tie::IxHash
 
Otherwise, Krazy should work with all known operating systems where
Qt4 and perl are available. If this is not true, please let me know.
