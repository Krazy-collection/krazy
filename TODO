    - Check if there are spaces for operators: i.e a=b v.s. a = b (??)

Yes. Shared libraries to be precise (see below).

Errr bad example..... libemailfunctions isn't a real shared lib, it's just
a convenience library (see the Makefile.am howto for the distinction).
So there's no problem for that one, unless there are apps which use those
functions *via* libkdepim, without linking to libemailfunctions directly...
but I doubt it.

> where #define LIBEMAILFUNCTIONS_EXPORT KDE_EXPORT??
Yes (by default - set those#defines in a central place, like a kdepim_export.h,
for consistency with kdelibs_export.h and koffice_export.h)
